# LSON

Lisp inspired serialization. Lisp has a wonderfully simple syntax. This can be used to [write code](https://www.amazon.com/Little-LISPer-Third-Daniel-Friedman/dp/0023397632) or potentially a simple alternative when a simple format is needed. The use of S-Expressions as a format for data has been outlined in the following [draft](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/Sexp.txt).
